;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides the following two commands via Ivy interface:
;;
;; - `counsel-org-clock-context' displays the currently clocked task as well as
;;   its ancestors and descendants. If there is no currently running clock,
;;   this function behaves the same as `counsel-org-clock-history'.
;; - `counsel-org-clock-history' displays entries in `org-clock-history'
;;   variable.

;;; Code:
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'ivy)
(require 'org-clock)
